## DevPost
### Clearly describe the problem you addressed
-- Homeless Outreach teams need an application that allows them to efficiently respond to 
community referrals.

### Tell the story behind your project
We created an application that allows users to send a referral that can include a picture
of the camp/site and its geolocation. Service providers receiving the referrals can view
the camps on a map with markers to be able to easily locate camps. We wanted the
application to be accessible to the majority of people on the island so we incorporated
text integration. With text integration people without a smartphone can also refer
individuals to service providers for assistance and outreach services.

### Explain the impact if your solution were to be implemented
More homeless people would be able to be connected to the appropriate resources to
assist with housing, employment, mental health services, substance use, family services,
etc. for stabilization to be housed and sustain housing and living. With text integration,
referrals can be made throughout a broader audience. Low income individuals who have
free phones through the Lifeline Assistance Program (more widely known as the Obama
Phone and commonly obtained through BlueJay wireless tents throughout the island)
may also access this service. Text integration provides opportunities and access to
resources for everyone to help everyone.

### Explain why your solution is sustainable
This model is sustainable because it is a simple form for users to be able to
communicate with the appropriate service providers to assist the homeless. For the
service providers it allows a simple view with a map to locate campsites for outreach
teams. Text integration can also later be expanded beyond this prototypes use to send
automatic reminders for clientâ€™s appointments or it can even provide a way for the
homeless to search for resources through text when they are not able to access
computer and internet.

### Describe how your team worked with the Department Challenge Sponse to identify and address key issues
Our team spoke to Kimo from IHS for information on their referral process, common
emergencies outreach professionals respond to, how IHS utilizes data, how service
providers other than IHS respond to and receive referrals, how IHS determines who is
within their jurisdiction to aid the homeless, and what their current database is like. Our
team members also spoke to a current and a former case manager at IHS, and other
service providers from other agencies who work with the homeless on their perspectives
of what they would find useful for their field work.
